How do I store an obje

--

class Room:
	
	__init__(self, name):
	room_name = name
	# Locations have a list (ordered, mutable) of object IDs contained within them
	# location is a coordinate of two values, x an y. Scope of project will not have z values for height. 
	# A way to store open doors/paths directions (I.G., 'east : door', 'south : closed')
	
	
class RoomData:
	# Class intended to store room objects with their location (coordinates) and etc.

	
class ObjectBody:
	#Stores object ID (how is this created?), name, and many other values
